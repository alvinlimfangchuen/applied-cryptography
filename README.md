#  Applied Cryptography Application :lock: 
Developed in 2020 for my Applied Cryptography class, this Python-based GUI application serves as an interactive tool that illustrates RSA encryption techniques. Leveraging the Tkinter library, the application provides a graphical user interface where users can generate encryption keys and also input messages for encoding, encryption, decryption, and decoding. This hands-on approach facilitates visual comprehension and a deeper understanding of the mechanics of applied cryptography.

## :computer: Installation

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Firstly, make sure you have Python3 and pip installed on your machine. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alvinlimfangchuen/applied-cryptography.git
```

## :rocket: Usage
To start the application, run the main Python script from your command line:
```bash
python rsa.py
```
## :hammer_and_wrench: Features
1. Generate RSA encryption keys :key:
2. Encode a message :writing_hand:
3. Encrypt a message :closed_lock_with_key:
4. Decrypt a message :unlock:
5. Decode a message :mag_right:

## :framed_picture: User Interface
The application uses Tkinter for GUI. Here's what it looks like:
